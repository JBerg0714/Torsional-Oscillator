# Using a TeachSpin Torsional Oscillator to calculate angular position and angular velocity from voltage measurements.

The purpose for this research was to calibrate the TeachSpin Torsional Oscillator. In addition to this goal, the overall objective was to complete the first chapter of (5) tests provided in the TeachSpin Torsional Oscillator Guide. In completing this sections, this would ensure that the Oscillator was in fact calibrated.

## Motivation 

The Physics Department had owned three Torsional Oscillators for many years and they had gotten minimal hands on use. The original goal was to analyze the torsional oscillation of all three oscillators as they were hooked up to one another. About 2/3 of the way through the semester it became obvious that there was not enough time to complete this goal. 

## Coding Style 

All coding was completed in Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter - an acronym meaning Python). Below in the "Notebooks" section are links to each jupyter notebook used during the research. Within each jupyter notebook are notes to help walk you through what the code means.

The only source for this research was the TeachSpin Torsional Oscillator Guide that came with the apparatus. The following is a link to the website from which it was purchased: [TeachSpin Website](http://www.teachspin.com/torsional-oscillator.html)
